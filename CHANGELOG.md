# Changelog

All notable changes to this project are documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [1.17.0]
### Added
- `Get-ADForestConsolidation` / `Export-ADForestConsolidationHTML`: offline, file-based multi-domain/forest consolidation over this module's own existing JSON exports - forest score rollup, per-category heatmap, cross-domain trust-risk correlation, and a domain comparison table (a check comparable to PingCastle's paid "Conso" report, implemented independently and offered for free).
- New `src/ForestConsolidation.ps1`. This is a post-processing feature, not a live-AD detection module: it performs no LDAP/AD queries, requires no credentials or network access, and is **not** added to `Main.ps1`'s `$allTests`. It is a standalone command run after one-or-more `Start-ADSecurityAudit` runs already exist, reading their `AD_Security_Audit_<timestamp>.json` + `AD_Security_Score_<timestamp>.json` exports pairwise (one pair per domain) entirely offline.
- Forest-wide score and per-category heatmap reuse the exact worst-category (MAX) aggregation semantics `Get-ADRiskScore` already uses at the per-domain level, rather than a new averaging formula - the forest is only as strong as its weakest domain.
- Cross-domain trust-risk enrichment: any `Test-ADDomainTrusts` finding whose target domain also has a report present in the consolidated input set gets its `Details` annotated with that domain's own `TotalScore`/`MaturityLevel`/`MaturityLabel`; a finding whose target domain isn't present is left unannotated rather than erroring.
- A domain seen in a prior consolidated run (via the new `-PriorConsolidationPath` parameter) but missing from the current input is flagged as "not scanned this run" in `MissingDomains` instead of being silently dropped from history.
- Registered in `ADSecurityAudit.psm1` (dot-source + `Export-ModuleMember`) and `ADSecurityAudit.psd1` (`FunctionsToExport`). No changes to the existing per-domain finding schema, JSON, CSV, or HTML export - this feature only reads those files.

## [1.16.2]
### Changed
- **HTML report - consolidated findings**: findings that fire once per affected object (e.g. `AdminSDHolder ACL Compromise` across several principals, or the two SID History Injection checks across several accounts) previously rendered as N separate top-level `<details>` blocks with identical Category/Impact/Remediation text repeated each time. The report now groups findings by `Category` + `Issue` and renders **one** consolidated block per group: Impact, Remediation, and any MITRE/ANSSI tags are shown once, and every affected object is listed underneath with its own specific description (which still carries the per-object detail, e.g. which principal/SID/rights) and its own detection timestamp. A small count badge ("N objects") appears in the finding title when a group has more than one member. Findings that only ever fire once render exactly as they did in v1.16.1 - no visual change for the common single-object case.
- This is a report-rendering change only. `Get-ADRiskScore`, the JSON export, and the CSV export are unaffected - they still emit one row/object per finding, so nothing downstream that consumes the raw data (dashboards, SIEM ingestion, diffing between runs) needs to change.

## [1.16.1]
### Fixed
- **Character encoding**: `src/Reporting.ps1` contained literal emoji saved without a UTF-8 BOM, which Windows PowerShell 5.1 mangled into mojibake (e.g. `ðŸ”´`) both on-screen and in the exported HTML report. Replaced every emoji literal with an HTML numeric character reference, making the source pure ASCII and immune to this regardless of file encoding or console codepage.
- **`Test-ADDnsSecurity` / DNS zone transfer check**: `Get-DnsServerZoneTransfer` is not a real cmdlet in the `DnsServer` module (verified against Microsoft's documentation) and always failed with "term not recognized." Zone-transfer settings are now read from the `SecureSecondaries`/`SecondaryServers` properties already present on the `Get-DnsServerZone` result. Also corrected the finding's remediation text, which cited a nonexistent `Set-DnsServerZoneTransfer` cmdlet (`Set-DnsServerPrimaryZone -SecureSecondaries` is correct).
- **`Get-ADTier0Principal` / `PrivilegedGroupsString`**: fixed "The property 'PrivilegedGroupsString' cannot be found on this object" - the property is now declared at object construction instead of being added after the fact, which PowerShell's `[PSCustomObject]` literal doesn't support.
- **`Test-ADGpoDeployedSecrets` / script-credential scan**: fixed "Cannot convert 'System.Object[]' to the type 'System.String'" - a missing pair of parentheses around two `Join-Path` calls caused PowerShell to chain them into a single malformed argument list instead of building a two-element array.
- **`Test-ADCSWeakCertificate` / ROCA check**: added a fallback to the legacy `PublicKey.Key` API when `GetRSAPublicKey()` isn't resolvable (older .NET Framework hosts), so weak-modulus/ROCA detection no longer silently skips certificates on those hosts.
- **`Test-ADCoercionAndRelayExposure` / Spooler+WebClient check**: querying both services in a single `Get-Service` call meant a missing `WebClient` service (common on modern/Core builds) failed the whole call and silently lost the `Spooler` result too, then retried 3x with exponential backoff for a result that could never succeed. The two services are now queried independently, and a missing `WebClient` service is treated as a normal "not installed" outcome rather than a retryable error.
- **`DomainAdminEquivalence.ps1`**: 6 findings (AdminSDHolder Ghost Account, Shadow Credentials Detected, both SID History Injection findings, Legacy Logon Script Defined, AdminSDHolder ACL Compromise) never populated the `Impact` field, leaving it blank in the report. All 6 now have an explicit impact statement; the HTML report also now shows a placeholder instead of a blank paragraph if any field is ever empty in the future.
- **HTML report - category risk bars**: the colored fill bars under "Risk by Category" never rendered (numbers showed, bars stayed grey) because `.cat-bar-track`/`.cat-bar-fill` were `<span>` elements with no `display: block`, and browsers ignore `width`/`height` on default inline elements. Both now render correctly.

### Changed
- **Risk scoring model** (`Get-ADRiskScore`): replaced the additive-sum-capped-at-100 category score with a diminishing-returns model (`Score = 100 * (1 - product of (1 - weight/100) across findings)`). Previously, 2-3 Critical findings in one category (weight 40 each) saturated it to 100/100 outright, which made the global score uninformative in any environment with a handful of Criticals. Scores now approach 100 smoothly as findings accumulate. **This changes the numeric score compared to prior versions** - a report re-run against the same environment will show a different (generally lower, more differentiated) score than under v1.16.0 and earlier. The `CategoryScores` output also gains a `RawPoints` field (the old additive sum) for transparency.
- **Default retry policy** (`Invoke-ADQueryWithRetry`, used throughout the tool for AD/network calls): `MaxAttempts` default reduced from 3 to 2, `DelaySeconds` from 2 to 1, cutting the maximum wasted time on a failed operation from ~6s to ~1s. Combined with the WebClient fix above, this meaningfully shortens total run time in environments with several DCs or partially-unreachable hosts.
- **HTML report**: individual findings now render as collapsible `<details>` elements (collapsed by default); each severity section has "Expand All"/"Collapse All" buttons; the Executive Summary cards are now clickable links to their corresponding severity section.
- **PingCastle references**: reworded throughout the codebase, README, and CHANGELOG from "parity"/"-style"/"-aligned" phrasing to "comparable"/"similar in spirit to" phrasing, and added an independence disclaimer to the README. These are feature comparisons only; ADSecurityAudit is not affiliated with, endorsed by, or a derivative of PingCastle/Netwrix.
- **README**: installation instructions now lead with running the module in place (`Import-Module .\ADSecurityAudit.psd1`, no copy step) with a matching update procedure; the previous "copy into a PSModulePath directory" method is retained as a secondary option with its own update steps. The ~100-line duplicated version history was condensed to a short pointer at this file.
- Added a progress bar (`Write-Progress`) to the main audit test loop and to the report-export steps, so long runs show visible progress instead of appearing to hang.

## [1.16.0]
### Added
- Attack-path graph (`Get-ADControlPathGraph`) and indirect-privilege findings (`Test-ADControlPaths`) reaching Tier-0 via ACL/membership/ownership chains.
- Optional BloodHound-compatible edge export (`Export-ADControlPathGraphBloodHound`).
- 'Control Paths to Tier-0' HTML report section.

## [1.15.0]
### Added
- `Test-ADRodcSecurity`: Read-Only Domain Controller security posture (a check comparable to a PingCastle rule).

## [1.14.0]
### Added
- `Test-ADExchangeEscalation`: Exchange-in-AD privilege escalation (Exchange Windows Permissions / WriteDACL) (a check comparable to a PingCastle rule).

## [1.13.0]
### Added
- `Test-ADKnownDCVulnerabilities`: Known DC vulnerabilities by patch/build (MS14-068, MS17-010, ZeroLogon, PrintNightmare, BadSuccessor) (a check comparable to a PingCastle rule).

## [1.12.0]
### Added
- `Test-ADGpoDeployedSecrets`: GPO-deployed secrets & insecure settings (GPP cpassword, script credentials) (a check comparable to a PingCastle rule).

## [1.11.0]
### Added
- `Test-ADStaleObjectDepth`: Stale-object & hygiene depth (PASSWD_NOTREQD, primaryGroupID, duplicate SPNs, DC registration) (a check comparable to a PingCastle rule).
- Accounts with PASSWD_NOTREQD Set check: `userAccountControl` bit 0x0020.
- Non-Default primaryGroupID (Membership Hiding) check: flags user/computer objects whose `primaryGroupID` does not match the expected default for their object type, distinguishing the legitimate Domain Controllers RID (516) for genuine DCs from a suspicious value elsewhere.
- Duplicate Service Principal Names check: case-insensitive SPN index across users and computers, reporting all holders.
- DC Subnet/Site Registration Gap check: cross-checks each Domain Controller's IPv4 address against AD Sites & Services subnet objects (`Get-ADReplicationSubnet`, live-only).
- Insufficient Domain Controller Count check: flags a domain with fewer than 2 Domain Controllers.
- Snapshot-aware for the PASSWD_NOTREQD, primaryGroupID, duplicate-SPN, and DC-count checks; `Get-ADSnapshot`'s `Users`/`Computers` collection now also includes `PrimaryGroupID` (users) and `ServicePrincipalNames`/`SamAccountName` (computers). The DC subnet/site registration check always performs one live `Get-ADReplicationSubnet` call, consistent with other live-only sub-checks.

## [1.10.0]
### Added
- `Test-ADKerberosHardening`: Kerberos hardening depth (AES enforcement, FAST/armoring, cross-trust TGT delegation) (a check comparable to a PingCastle rule).
- RC4 Kerberos encryption still permitted check: Tier-0 privileged accounts and krbtgt via `msDS-SupportedEncryptionTypes` bitmask, trusts missing the `TRUST_USES_AES_KEYS` attribute, and (live-only) the domain-wide "Configure encryption types allowed for Kerberos" GPO/registry policy.
- Kerberos Armoring (FAST) not enabled check: KDC-side and client-side `EnableCbacAndArmor` GPO/registry policy, with a direct per-DC registry fallback when no linked GPO defines a setting (live-only).
- Cross-Trust TGT Delegation Enabled check: flags trusts whose `trustAttributes` has the `CROSS_ORGANIZATION_ENABLE_TGT_DELEGATION` bit set.
- Snapshot-aware for the account-level RC4 check (`Snapshot.Users` + the Tier-0 set) and both trust-level checks (`Snapshot.Trusts`); the domain-wide encryption-type policy and Kerberos Armoring (FAST) checks are live-only GPO/registry reads and are skipped entirely when run from a snapshot, consistent with `Test-ADLegacyAuthSurface` and `Test-ADCoercionAndRelayExposure`.

## [1.9.0]
### Added
- `Test-ADLegacyAuthSurface`: Legacy auth & name-poisoning surface (SMBv1, signing, LM/NTLMv1, LLMNR, WSUS-HTTP) (a check comparable to a PingCastle rule).
- SMBv1 enabled/not-disabled-by-policy check, SMB signing not required check, LM/NTLMv1 permitted check (`LmCompatibilityLevel` < 3), LLMNR not disabled by policy check, and WSUS delivered over HTTP check.
- GPO-linked registry policy values are read via `Get-GPRegistryValue` (Domain Controllers OU first, then domain root); falls back to a direct per-DC registry read only when no linked GPO defines a setting, so the finding always distinguishes a policy-enforced value (naming the source GPO) from an unset/local one.
- Live-only: registered in `Invoke-ADRuleSet`'s test registry with an optional `-Snapshot` parameter for consistency, but returns no findings when run from a snapshot since GPO-linked registry policy state has no snapshot equivalent.

## [1.8.0]
### Added
- `Test-ADDnsSecurity`: AD-integrated DNS security (DnsAdmins, zone transfer, insecure updates, ADIDNS) (a check comparable to a PingCastle rule).
- DnsAdmins non-default membership check (DC code-execution path via `ServerLevelPluginDll`), zone-transfer exposure check, insecure dynamic-update check, and ADIDNS broad CreateChild ACL check on AD-integrated zone objects.
- `Get-DnsServerZone`/`Get-DnsServerZoneTransfer` used when the DnsServer RSAT module is available, with a best-effort `dNSProperty` attribute fallback otherwise.
- Snapshot-aware for the DnsAdmins membership check (`Snapshot.Groups`); registered in `Invoke-ADRuleSet`'s test registry. The zone-level checks are live-only and are skipped entirely when run from a snapshot.

### Fixed
- HTML report footer's module version string was hardcoded and had drifted from `ModuleVersion` since v1.7.0; it is now read from the module manifest at import time instead of being duplicated.

## [1.7.0]
### Added
- `Test-ADCSExtended`: AD CS beyond ESC1/2/3/7 (ESC4, ESC8, ROCA, weak CA crypto) (a check comparable to a PingCastle rule).

## [1.6.0]
### Added
- `Test-ADCoercionAndRelayExposure`: Coercion & NTLM relay exposure (PrinterBug / WebClient / LDAP signing / channel binding) (a check comparable to a PingCastle rule).

## [1.5.0]
### Added
- `Test-ADDomainHardeningFlags`: Domain hardening flags (dsHeuristics, pre-Win2000, anonymous binding) (a check comparable to a PingCastle rule).
- Positionally parses `dSHeuristics` for dangerous settings: anonymous access (char 7 = '2'), List Object security mode (char 1 = '1'), and AdminSDHolder exclusion mask weakening (char 16 non-zero).
- Flags broad membership (Authenticated Users/Everyone/ANONYMOUS LOGON) in the built-in Pre-Windows 2000 Compatible Access group.
- Performs a strictly read-only anonymous LDAP/RootDSE bind probe; success is the finding, refusal is the secure state.
- `Get-ADSnapshot` now also collects `DsHeuristics` and `PreWin2000Members` (additive snapshot keys); the dsHeuristics and Pre-Win2000 checks are snapshot-aware. The anonymous-bind probe is a live network operation and is skipped when running from a snapshot.

## [1.4.0]
### Added
- `Test-ADMachineAccountQuota`: flags `ms-DS-MachineAccountQuota` left at the unmodified default of 10 (High) or any other non-zero value (Medium), which lets any authenticated user self-service-join computer accounts - a common foothold for RBCD relay and SamAccountName-spoofing privilege escalation.
- `Get-ADSnapshot` now also collects `ms-DS-MachineAccountQuota` (additive snapshot key); the new check is snapshot-aware and registered in `Invoke-ADRuleSet`.

## [1.3.0]
### Added
- `Get-ADSnapshot` collect-once pass with `-ToJson` and `Invoke-ADRuleSet` rule-runner.
- `Start-ADSecurityAudit -FromSnapshot <path>` offline re-analysis.
- Shared `Get-ADTier0Principal` privileged-principal helper.
### Changed
- Rule-runner invokes audit functions defensively (passes `-Snapshot` only to functions that declare it), so snapshot-unaware modules are unaffected.

## [1.2.0]
### Added
- Risk score (0–100), per-category sub-scores, and ANSSI-style 1–5 maturity level.
- MITRE ATT&CK technique and ANSSI control tagging on every finding via a central mapping table (`src/Scoring.ps1`).
- `MitreTechnique`, `AnssiControl`, `Weight` fields on `ADSecurityFinding` (additive).
- Score/maturity/MITRE sections in the HTML report; new CSV columns.

### Changed
- Output schema is now contract-stable: finding fields are additive only.

## [1.1.0]
### Added
- Domain Controller failover support for improved reliability.
- `Invoke-ADQueryWithRetry` helper for network resilience (exponential backoff).
- Result pagination for large AD queries (prevents timeouts in large environments).
- `ConvertTo-SafeCsvValue` function for safe CSV exports.

### Fixed
- CSV injection vulnerability in report exports.
- Converted 40+ silent failures to proper try/catch with verbose logging.

## [1.0.1]
### Fixed
- Nested group detection in `Test-ADPrivilegedGroups`.
- LAPS schema path lookup.
- SID lookup in DCSync detection.
- Orphaned `adminCount` detection now uses recursive group membership.
- ESC1 detection now checks enrollment permissions.
- Kerberoasting detection now factors in encryption type and password age.

## [1.0.0]
### Added
- Initial release: core AD security auditing, AD CS scanning, KRBTGT monitoring,
  domain trust auditing, LAPS verification, audit policy validation, and
  constrained delegation analysis.
