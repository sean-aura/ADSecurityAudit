# Changelog

All notable changes to this project are documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [1.14.0]
### Added
- `Test-ADExchangeEscalation`: Exchange-in-AD privilege escalation (Exchange Windows Permissions / WriteDACL) (PingCastle parity).

## [1.13.0]
### Added
- `Test-ADKnownDCVulnerabilities`: Known DC vulnerabilities by patch/build (MS14-068, MS17-010, ZeroLogon, PrintNightmare, BadSuccessor) (PingCastle parity).

## [1.12.0]
### Added
- `Test-ADGpoDeployedSecrets`: GPO-deployed secrets & insecure settings (GPP cpassword, script credentials) (PingCastle parity).

## [1.11.0]
### Added
- `Test-ADStaleObjectDepth`: Stale-object & hygiene depth (PASSWD_NOTREQD, primaryGroupID, duplicate SPNs, DC registration) (PingCastle parity).
- Accounts with PASSWD_NOTREQD Set check: `userAccountControl` bit 0x0020.
- Non-Default primaryGroupID (Membership Hiding) check: flags user/computer objects whose `primaryGroupID` does not match the expected default for their object type, distinguishing the legitimate Domain Controllers RID (516) for genuine DCs from a suspicious value elsewhere.
- Duplicate Service Principal Names check: case-insensitive SPN index across users and computers, reporting all holders.
- DC Subnet/Site Registration Gap check: cross-checks each Domain Controller's IPv4 address against AD Sites & Services subnet objects (`Get-ADReplicationSubnet`, live-only).
- Insufficient Domain Controller Count check: flags a domain with fewer than 2 Domain Controllers.
- Snapshot-aware for the PASSWD_NOTREQD, primaryGroupID, duplicate-SPN, and DC-count checks; `Get-ADSnapshot`'s `Users`/`Computers` collection now also includes `PrimaryGroupID` (users) and `ServicePrincipalNames`/`SamAccountName` (computers). The DC subnet/site registration check always performs one live `Get-ADReplicationSubnet` call, consistent with other live-only sub-checks.

## [1.10.0]
### Added
- `Test-ADKerberosHardening`: Kerberos hardening depth (AES enforcement, FAST/armoring, cross-trust TGT delegation) (PingCastle parity).
- RC4 Kerberos encryption still permitted check: Tier-0 privileged accounts and krbtgt via `msDS-SupportedEncryptionTypes` bitmask, trusts missing the `TRUST_USES_AES_KEYS` attribute, and (live-only) the domain-wide "Configure encryption types allowed for Kerberos" GPO/registry policy.
- Kerberos Armoring (FAST) not enabled check: KDC-side and client-side `EnableCbacAndArmor` GPO/registry policy, with a direct per-DC registry fallback when no linked GPO defines a setting (live-only).
- Cross-Trust TGT Delegation Enabled check: flags trusts whose `trustAttributes` has the `CROSS_ORGANIZATION_ENABLE_TGT_DELEGATION` bit set.
- Snapshot-aware for the account-level RC4 check (`Snapshot.Users` + the Tier-0 set) and both trust-level checks (`Snapshot.Trusts`); the domain-wide encryption-type policy and Kerberos Armoring (FAST) checks are live-only GPO/registry reads and are skipped entirely when run from a snapshot, consistent with `Test-ADLegacyAuthSurface` and `Test-ADCoercionAndRelayExposure`.

## [1.9.0]
### Added
- `Test-ADLegacyAuthSurface`: Legacy auth & name-poisoning surface (SMBv1, signing, LM/NTLMv1, LLMNR, WSUS-HTTP) (PingCastle parity).
- SMBv1 enabled/not-disabled-by-policy check, SMB signing not required check, LM/NTLMv1 permitted check (`LmCompatibilityLevel` < 3), LLMNR not disabled by policy check, and WSUS delivered over HTTP check.
- GPO-linked registry policy values are read via `Get-GPRegistryValue` (Domain Controllers OU first, then domain root); falls back to a direct per-DC registry read only when no linked GPO defines a setting, so the finding always distinguishes a policy-enforced value (naming the source GPO) from an unset/local one.
- Live-only: registered in `Invoke-ADRuleSet`'s test registry with an optional `-Snapshot` parameter for consistency, but returns no findings when run from a snapshot since GPO-linked registry policy state has no snapshot equivalent.

## [1.8.0]
### Added
- `Test-ADDnsSecurity`: AD-integrated DNS security (DnsAdmins, zone transfer, insecure updates, ADIDNS) (PingCastle parity).
- DnsAdmins non-default membership check (DC code-execution path via `ServerLevelPluginDll`), zone-transfer exposure check, insecure dynamic-update check, and ADIDNS broad CreateChild ACL check on AD-integrated zone objects.
- `Get-DnsServerZone`/`Get-DnsServerZoneTransfer` used when the DnsServer RSAT module is available, with a best-effort `dNSProperty` attribute fallback otherwise.
- Snapshot-aware for the DnsAdmins membership check (`Snapshot.Groups`); registered in `Invoke-ADRuleSet`'s test registry. The zone-level checks are live-only and are skipped entirely when run from a snapshot.

### Fixed
- HTML report footer's module version string was hardcoded and had drifted from `ModuleVersion` since v1.7.0; it is now read from the module manifest at import time instead of being duplicated.

## [1.7.0]
### Added
- `Test-ADCSExtended`: AD CS beyond ESC1/2/3/7 (ESC4, ESC8, ROCA, weak CA crypto) (PingCastle parity).

## [1.6.0]
### Added
- `Test-ADCoercionAndRelayExposure`: Coercion & NTLM relay exposure (PrinterBug / WebClient / LDAP signing / channel binding) (PingCastle parity).

## [1.5.0]
### Added
- `Test-ADDomainHardeningFlags`: Domain hardening flags (dsHeuristics, pre-Win2000, anonymous binding) (PingCastle parity).
- Positionally parses `dSHeuristics` for dangerous settings: anonymous access (char 7 = '2'), List Object security mode (char 1 = '1'), and AdminSDHolder exclusion mask weakening (char 16 non-zero).
- Flags broad membership (Authenticated Users/Everyone/ANONYMOUS LOGON) in the built-in Pre-Windows 2000 Compatible Access group.
- Performs a strictly read-only anonymous LDAP/RootDSE bind probe; success is the finding, refusal is the secure state.
- `Get-ADSnapshot` now also collects `DsHeuristics` and `PreWin2000Members` (additive snapshot keys); the dsHeuristics and Pre-Win2000 checks are snapshot-aware. The anonymous-bind probe is a live network operation and is skipped when running from a snapshot.

## [1.4.0]
### Added
- `Test-ADMachineAccountQuota`: flags `ms-DS-MachineAccountQuota` left at the unmodified default of 10 (High) or any other non-zero value (Medium), which lets any authenticated user self-service-join computer accounts - a common foothold for RBCD relay and SamAccountName-spoofing privilege escalation.
- `Get-ADSnapshot` now also collects `ms-DS-MachineAccountQuota` (additive snapshot key); the new check is snapshot-aware and registered in `Invoke-ADRuleSet`.

## [1.3.0]
### Added
- `Get-ADSnapshot` collect-once pass with `-ToJson` and `Invoke-ADRuleSet` rule-runner.
- `Start-ADSecurityAudit -FromSnapshot <path>` offline re-analysis.
- Shared `Get-ADTier0Principal` privileged-principal helper.
### Changed
- Rule-runner invokes audit functions defensively (passes `-Snapshot` only to functions that declare it), so snapshot-unaware modules are unaffected.

## [1.2.0]
### Added
- Risk score (0–100), per-category sub-scores, and ANSSI-style 1–5 maturity level.
- MITRE ATT&CK technique and ANSSI control tagging on every finding via a central mapping table (`src/Scoring.ps1`).
- `MitreTechnique`, `AnssiControl`, `Weight` fields on `ADSecurityFinding` (additive).
- Score/maturity/MITRE sections in the HTML report; new CSV columns.

### Changed
- Output schema is now contract-stable: finding fields are additive only.

## [1.1.0]
### Added
- Domain Controller failover support for improved reliability.
- `Invoke-ADQueryWithRetry` helper for network resilience (exponential backoff).
- Result pagination for large AD queries (prevents timeouts in large environments).
- `ConvertTo-SafeCsvValue` function for safe CSV exports.

### Fixed
- CSV injection vulnerability in report exports.
- Converted 40+ silent failures to proper try/catch with verbose logging.

## [1.0.1]
### Fixed
- Nested group detection in `Test-ADPrivilegedGroups`.
- LAPS schema path lookup.
- SID lookup in DCSync detection.
- Orphaned `adminCount` detection now uses recursive group membership.
- ESC1 detection now checks enrollment permissions.
- Kerberoasting detection now factors in encryption type and password age.

## [1.0.0]
### Added
- Initial release: core AD security auditing, AD CS scanning, KRBTGT monitoring,
  domain trust auditing, LAPS verification, audit policy validation, and
  constrained delegation analysis.
