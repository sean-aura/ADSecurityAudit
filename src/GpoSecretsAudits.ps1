#region GPO-Deployed Secrets & Insecure Settings Audit (GPP cpassword, script credentials)
#
# Scans SYSVOL/GPO content for secrets and settings that GPOs push out to
# every affected computer/user: leftover Group Policy Preferences (GPP)
# `cpassword` values (MS14-025), plaintext-looking credentials referenced in
# logon/startup scripts, and insecure settings deployed via GPO (firewall
# disabled, weak folder options, insecure RDP), and GPO-deployed User Rights
# Assignments that grant a sensitive logon right to an overly broad
# principal (Everyone/ANONYMOUS LOGON/Authenticated Users).
# PingCastle-comparable check(s): P-DelegationGPOData, P-DelegationFileDeployed,
# P-DelegationLoginScript, S-FirewallScript, S-FolderOptions,
# S-TerminalServicesGPO, A-AnonymousAuthorizedGPO.
#
# DETECTION ONLY: this module reads SYSVOL policy files (GPP XML, referenced
# scripts) and GPO-linked registry policy values. A `cpassword` value found
# in GPP XML is reported by PRESENCE and FILE PATH ONLY - it is never
# decrypted, decoded, or printed. A credential pattern found in a script is
# reported by LOCATION (file/line) only - the matched line's sensitive
# content is never echoed verbatim into a finding. Nothing here decrypts,
# reuses, exfiltrates, or acts on any discovered secret, and no exploitation,
# coercion, relay, or PoC traffic is ever sent.

# GPP preference files known to carry a `cpassword` attribute when a
# password is set via Group Policy Preferences (MS14-025).

function Get-ADGpoSecretsSysvolPolicyRoot {
    <#
    .SYNOPSIS
        Resolves the SYSVOL \Policies path for the current domain.
    .DESCRIPTION
        Read-only path resolution helper, consistent with the SYSVOL path
        already used for permission checks in Test-ADGroupPolicies.

        The server component of the UNC path uses the active
        Set-ADSecurityAuditTargetServer -Server override when one is set,
        rather than always using the domain's DNS name. A bare domain name
        in a UNC path (\\domain.tld\SYSVOL\...) is resolved via DFS
        Namespace referral, which - like DC-locator for AD queries - picks
        a DC based on the CALLING MACHINE's own site/subnet proximity, not
        necessarily the domain actually being audited. This is the same
        "closest DC" ambiguity Get-AD*/Get-GP* cmdlets have via -Server;
        Get-Acl on a UNC path has no -Server parameter at all, so the only
        way to pin it to a specific DC is to put that DC directly in the
        path itself.

function Test-ADGpoDeployedSecrets {
    <#
    .SYNOPSIS
        Audits SYSVOL/GPO content for deployed secrets and insecure settings.
    .DESCRIPTION
        Four independent, read-only checks against each GPO's SYSVOL policy
        folder:
          1. GPP cpassword Found in SYSVOL - parses the standard GPP XML
             files (Groups.xml, Services.xml, ScheduledTasks.xml, Drives.xml,
             DataSources.xml, Printers.xml) for a `cpassword` attribute.
             Flagged by PRESENCE and FILE PATH ONLY; the value is never
             decrypted or included in the finding.
          2. Credentials Referenced in Logon/Startup Script - pattern-scans
             scripts under each GPO's \Machine\Scripts and \User\Scripts
             folders (and any script referenced by a linked logon/startup
             script GPO setting) for common credential-embedding patterns
             (net use /user:, ConvertTo-SecureString, runas /savecred,
             etc.). Reports the file and line number only, never the
             matched line's content.
          3. Insecure Setting Deployed via GPO - reads each GPO's
             GptTmpl.inf / registry.pol for a Windows Firewall profile
             explicitly disabled, weak Folder Options settings (hidden
             files/extensions forced visible off, i.e. hiding), and
             insecure Terminal Services/RDP settings (Network Level
             Authentication disabled, unencrypted RDP security layer
             allowed).
          4. GPO Grants Sensitive Logon Right to Broad Principal
             (PingCastle A-AnonymousAuthorizedGPO-comparable) - parses the
             same GptTmpl.inf's [Privilege Rights] section for
             SeNetworkLogonRight ("Access this computer from the network")
             or SeRemoteInteractiveLogonRight ("Allow log on through Remote
             Desktop Services") grants that include the SID for Everyone
             (S-1-1-0), ANONYMOUS LOGON (S-1-5-7), or Authenticated Users
             (S-1-5-11). Matched on SID, since GptTmpl.inf stores principals
             as SIDs, not resolved names. Reported as its own always-Critical
             finding, consistent with this module's convention that a broad
             principal (Everyone/Authenticated Users/Domain Users/ANONYMOUS
             LOGON) on any sensitive path is always Critical.
    .PARAMETER Snapshot
        Optional snapshot hashtable (from Get-ADSnapshot). Every check in
        this function is a SYSVOL/registry.pol read against a live file
        share, with no possible snapshot representation - so when -Snapshot
        is supplied, this entire test is SKIPPED (with a Write-Warning),
        performing zero live AD/network access, consistent with the other
        entirely-live-only tests in this module (e.g. Test-ADLegacyAuthSurface,
        Test-ADKnownDCVulnerabilities). Fixed in v1.19.1: prior to this it
        still performed live SYSVOL reads even with -Snapshot supplied
        (only the GPO *list* itself came from the snapshot) - unacceptable
        for a genuinely offline analysis where no DC/file-share path may
        even exist. Run this test live (without -Snapshot) for this coverage.
