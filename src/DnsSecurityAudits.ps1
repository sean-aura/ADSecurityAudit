#region AD-Integrated DNS Security Audit
#
# Audits AD-integrated DNS for the DNS-specific attack surface that most
# generic AD reviews miss: DnsAdmins group membership (a well-known
# Domain-Controller code-execution path via the DNS server's
# ServerLevelPluginDll mechanism), zone transfer exposure, insecure dynamic
# updates, overly broad child-object creation rights on zone objects
# (the "ADIDNS" spoofing/MITM surface), and stale/dangling DNS zone
# delegations. PingCastle-comparable check(s): P-DNSAdmin, P-DNSDelegation,
# A-DnsZoneTransfert, A-DnsZoneUpdate1, A-DnsZoneUpdate2,
# A-DnsZoneAUCreateChild.
#
# Snapshot-aware for the DnsAdmins membership check only: it reads the
# 'DnsAdmins' entry from Snapshot.Groups (Members flattened to DNs, same
# shape used by the Pre-Windows 2000 check in DomainHardeningAudits.ps1)
# when a snapshot is supplied. The per-zone checks (zone transfer, dynamic
# update, ADIDNS CreateChild ACL, and delegation staleness) read zone-level
# attributes (dNSProperty), ACLs (nTSecurityDescriptor), and delegation/NS
# records that are not part of the existing Snapshot.DnsZones shape
# (Name/DistinguishedName only), so - per the established -FromSnapshot
# contract of performing NO live AD/network access (see
# Test-ADCoercionAndRelayExposure, the anonymous-bind probe in
# Test-ADDomainHardeningFlags, and the ESC4/ESC8 checks in
# Test-ADCSExtended) - they are live-only and are skipped entirely when
# this function is invoked with -Snapshot.
#
# DETECTION ONLY: this module reads group membership, AD-integrated zone
# object attributes/ACLs, and (optionally) the read-only DNS Server
# PowerShell cmdlets `Get-DnsServerZone` (transfer settings are read from its
# SecureSecondaries/SecondaryServers properties - there is no separate
# "Get-DnsServerZoneTransfer" cmdlet) and `Get-DnsServerZoneDelegation`
# (delegation NS/glue enumeration). The delegation-staleness check also
# issues ordinary DNS SOA queries against already-published glue IP
# addresses, and optionally reads AD Sites & Services subnet objects
# (`Get-ADReplicationSubnet`) for an informational-only signal. It never
# creates, deletes, or modifies a DNS record or zone, never registers a
# plugin DLL or hostname, never claims an IP address, and performs no
# exploitation, coercion, relay, takeover, or PoC traffic.

# Well-known/service SIDs that legitimately end up referenced from DnsAdmins
# in some environments and should not be flagged as "non-default" human/
# service membership. DnsAdmins itself has NO members by default, so
# anything outside this short, well-known list is reported.

    <#
    .SYNOPSIS
        Audits AD-integrated DNS security: DnsAdmins membership, zone
        transfer exposure, insecure dynamic updates, ADIDNS
        (broad child-object creation), and stale/dangling zone delegations
        on AD-integrated zones.
    .DESCRIPTION
        Five checks:
          1. DnsAdmins group membership - any member outside a short list of
             well-known service SIDs is flagged (DnsAdmins is empty by
             default; membership grants a well-known DC code-execution path
             via the DNS server's ServerLevelPluginDll mechanism).
          2. DNS Zone Transfer Allowed - flags AD-integrated zones configured
             to transfer to any server or to any server listed as an NS
             record for the zone (i.e. not restricted to an explicit
             secondary-server list).
          3. Insecure Dynamic DNS Updates Enabled - flags zones allowing
             nonsecure (unauthenticated) dynamic updates.
          4. Authenticated Users Can Create Child Objects in DNS Zone
             (ADIDNS) - flags zones whose AD object ACL grants CreateChild
             (or an equivalently broad right) to Authenticated Users,
             Everyone, or ANONYMOUS LOGON, enabling arbitrary DNS record
             registration/spoofing.
          5. Stale/Dangling DNS Zone Delegation - for each AD-integrated
             zone's delegated child zones (`Get-DnsServerZoneDelegation`),
             confirms each delegation NS's glue IP still answers an
             authoritative SOA query for the child zone. A glue IP that no
             longer responds is the stale/dangling signal (per PingCastle's
             P-DNSDelegation): whoever can now claim that hostname or
             reclaim that IP can serve authoritative-looking answers for the
             sub-zone. Delegations that simply point outside this module's
             known AD Sites & Services subnets, but still answer correctly,
             are NOT flagged - that is common for legitimate delegations to
             non-AD infrastructure (e.g. a cloud DNS provider) and is
             recorded only as weak, informational context, never as the
             basis for a finding.

        Checks 2-4 prefer the read-only `Get-DnsServerZone` cmdlet (DnsServer
        RSAT module, reading its DynamicUpdate/SecureSecondaries properties)
        when available, and fall back to a best-effort read of the zone AD
        object's `dNSProperty` attribute when that module is not installed.
        If neither source yields a confident answer for a zone, that check
        is skipped for that zone (Verbose only) rather than guessing. Check
        5 has no `dNSProperty`-based fallback (delegation/NS records have no
        such representation) and is skipped entirely when the DnsServer
        module is unavailable.
    .PARAMETER Snapshot
        Optional snapshot hashtable (from Get-ADSnapshot). When supplied,
        the DnsAdmins membership check is derived from `Snapshot.Groups`
        instead of a live query. The zone-level checks (transfer, dynamic
        update, ADIDNS CreateChild, delegation staleness) read zone
        attributes/ACLs/delegation records that are not part of the current
        snapshot schema and are live-only network/AD operations, so -
        consistent with the -FromSnapshot contract of performing no live
        AD/network access - they are skipped entirely when -Snapshot is
        supplied.
