#region Exchange-in-AD Privilege Escalation Audit
#
# Detects Exchange-related security principals holding dangerous rights on
# the domain head object and/or the AdminSDHolder object (PrivExchange-style
# escalation path: Exchange Windows Permissions / Exchange Trusted
# Subsystem -> WriteDacl on the domain -> DCSync). Also flags the same
# exposure when it is a RESIDUAL ACE left behind after Exchange has been
# decommissioned from the forest, since the ACE itself does not get cleaned
# up automatically. PingCastle-comparable check(s): P-ExchangePrivEsc, P-ExchangeAdminSDHolder.
#
# DETECTION ONLY: every determination here is a read of nTSecurityDescriptor
# on the domain head and CN=AdminSDHolder,CN=System,<domain>, evaluated
# against a fixed list of well-known Exchange principal names. This module
# never sends a PrivExchange push-subscription request, an NTLM relay, or
# any other exploitation/coercion traffic to any host; it purely inspects
# ACLs that are already present.

# Well-known Exchange security principals that historically receive (or
# have received) elevated rights on the domain object as part of Exchange
# setup/RBAC (Exchange Windows Permissions, Exchange Trusted Subsystem) or
# that indicate an Exchange RBAC role group with domain-level reach
# (Organization Management). Matched case-insensitively against the ACE's
# resolved identity name, independent of Exchange still being installed.

# Rights that, if held by an Exchange principal on the domain head, allow an

    .SYNOPSIS
        Audits for Exchange-in-AD privilege escalation via WriteDACL on the
        domain object and Exchange-related ACEs on AdminSDHolder.
    .DESCRIPTION
        Reads the nTSecurityDescriptor of the domain head object and of
        CN=AdminSDHolder,CN=System,<domain DN> and flags any ACE granting
        GenericAll, WriteDacl, or WriteOwner to a well-known Exchange
        security principal (Exchange Windows Permissions, Exchange Trusted
        Subsystem, Exchange Servers, Exchange Enterprise Servers,
        Organization Management).

        This fires whether or not Exchange is currently installed in the
        forest: residual ACEs left behind after an Exchange decommission
        are just as exploitable as ACEs on a live Exchange deployment, so
        the presence of the ACE - not the presence of Exchange servers - is
        what is evaluated.

        Reuses Get-ADTier0Principal purely for descriptive context in
        Details (whether the affected principal is also a resolvable
        Tier-0 group); it does not gate detection.

        Detection only: reads nTSecurityDescriptor.Access. Performs no
        exploitation, PrivExchange push-subscription, NTLM relay, or any
        other coercion/PoC traffic to any host.
    .PARAMETER Snapshot
        Optional snapshot hashtable (from Get-ADSnapshot). When supplied
        and it contains ACLs.DomainRoot / ACLs.AdminSDHolder (collected by
        Get-ADSnapshot since v1.3.0), those flattened ACEs are used instead
        of live queries, so this audit fully supports -FromSnapshot with no
        snapshot schema change required.
