#region Machine Account Quota Audit
#
# Checks the domain-wide ms-DS-MachineAccountQuota attribute. By default,
# every authenticated domain user may join up to 10 computer accounts to the
# domain (the classic AD default), and any value greater than 0 lets
# unprivileged users create machine accounts they own. Self-service machine
# accounts are commonly abused as a foothold for resource-based constrained
# delegation (RBCD) relay attacks and SamAccountName-spoofing techniques
# (e.g. CVE-2021-42278/42287, "noPac") that escalate a low-privilege user to
# Domain Admin equivalence.
#
# Snapshot-aware per the v1.3.0 collection contract (docs/features/
# 02-domain-snapshot.md): reads $Snapshot.MachineAccountQuota when supplied,
# falling back to a live Get-ADObject read of the domain root's
# ms-DS-MachineAccountQuota attribute (Get-ADDomain does not expose this
# attribute directly).
#
# DETECTION ONLY: this is a single read-only LDAP attribute read. Nothing
# here creates, joins, or modifies any computer account.

    .SYNOPSIS
        Audits the domain's ms-DS-MachineAccountQuota attribute.
    .DESCRIPTION
        Flags a non-zero machine account quota, distinguishing between the
        unmodified default of 10 (Critical/High risk - never reviewed) and a
        lowered-but-still-non-zero value (Medium risk - still self-service).
        A quota of 0 (hardened: computer joins must be explicitly delegated)
        produces no finding.
    .PARAMETER Snapshot
        Optional snapshot hashtable (from Get-ADSnapshot). When supplied and
        it contains a 'MachineAccountQuota' key, that value is used instead
        of a live AD query.
    .PARAMETER Server
        Optional override for which domain/DC to query, as a domain FQDN
        (e.g. 'domainb.corp.com') or a specific DC FQDN/hostname. When
        omitted, defaults to the current user's own domain
        ($env:USERDNSDOMAIN) rather than letting Get-ADDomain perform its
        default "serverless" bind, which resolves against whatever domain
        the AD module's own ambient resolution picks - not necessarily the
        target domain, which is exactly the "checks Domain A instead of
        Domain B" symptom this default exists to avoid. Pass this
        explicitly only to target a domain OTHER than your own account's.
        Ignored when -Snapshot is supplied (no live AD access is performed
        in that mode).

        PDC-ONLY CHECK, NOTED ACCORDINGLY: ms-DS-MachineAccountQuota is a
        single domain-wide attribute on the domain root object, identical
        regardless of which DC answers - there is no per-DC variation to
        enumerate, unlike a true per-DC probe (e.g. Spooler/SMB-signing
        state, which genuinely differs DC to DC). This function therefore
        makes exactly one Get-ADObject call rather than using
        Get-ADSecurityAuditDomainController's per-DC enumeration. -Server
        still follows the module's normal three-mode contract via
        Resolve-ADSecurityAuditTargetServer: omitted or a domain name
        resolves to that domain's PDC Emulator specifically (the
        authoritative source for domain-wide config); an explicit,
        specific DC is honored exactly as given (never redirected to the
        PDC), since an operator naming one specific DC has often done so
        because it's the only one reachable for this engagement.
