#region Dangerous Permissions Audit

function Test-ADDangerousPermissions {
    <#
    .SYNOPSIS
        Audits Enterprise Key Admins scoping, dangerous rights on critical
        OUs (Domain Controllers, Users, Computers), and non-standard
        permissions on the Schema/Configuration naming context head objects.
    .PARAMETER Snapshot
        Optional snapshot hashtable (from Get-ADSnapshot). When supplied,
        reads Snapshot.ACLs.DomainRoot/.DomainControllersOU/.UsersContainer/
        .ComputersContainer/.SchemaNamingContext/.ConfigurationNamingContext
        and Snapshot.Groups instead of live queries - no live AD access is
        performed. Added in v1.19.0; Schema/Configuration NC coverage added
        in v1.23.6.
