#region LAPS Deployment Audits

    .SYNOPSIS
        Audits LAPS schema presence, computer coverage, and password expiration.
    .PARAMETER Snapshot
        Optional snapshot hashtable (from Get-ADSnapshot). When supplied, the
        schema-presence gate reads Snapshot.LapsSchema and the coverage/
        expiration analysis reads Snapshot.Computers - no live AD access is
        performed. Added in v1.19.0.
