#region Retest / Configuration-Maturity Delta Comparison (offline, file-based)
#
# This is a POST-PROCESSING feature, not a live-AD detection module. It
# performs NO LDAP/AD queries, uses NO credentials, and requires NO network
# access to any domain controller. It reads two of this module's own prior
# exports (AD_Security_Audit_<timestamp>.json, produced by an existing
# Start-ADSecurityAudit run - a pre-remediation baseline and a post-
# remediation retest of the SAME domain) and produces a structured delta:
# new / resolved / still-open / changed findings, score delta, per-category
# delta, and maturity delta.
#
# Its only hard contract dependency is the finding schema and the
# Get-ADRiskScore/Set-ADFindingMetadata output contract (src/Scoring.ps1,
# shipped since v1.2.0). It does not depend on which detection modules
# produced the underlying findings.
#
# SCORING ACROSS RUNS: both runs are recomputed through the CURRENT
# Get-ADRiskScore/Set-ADFindingMetadata, ignoring each run's originally-
# stored score sidecar values. If the baseline and retest were captured
# under different module versions, the mapping table in Scoring.ps1 may
# have changed between them - comparing stored scores directly would blend
# "posture changed" with "the ruler changed". Recomputing both against one,
# current ruler keeps the comparison apples-to-apples. Each run's own
# recorded ModuleVersion (from its score sidecar, when present) is still
# surfaced in BaselineMeta/RetestMeta for context.
#
# This feature is NOT registered in Main.ps1's $allTests - it isn't a
# per-domain live-AD check, it's a standalone command run after two
# Start-ADSecurityAudit runs of the same domain already exist (the same
# pattern as Get-ADForestConsolidation / Export-ADControlPathGraphBloodHound).

function Get-ADRetestComparison {
    <#
    .SYNOPSIS
        Offline, file-based comparison between two prior Start-ADSecurityAudit
        exports of the same domain (a pre-remediation baseline and a
        post-remediation retest).
    .DESCRIPTION
        Reads both runs' findings JSON, recomputes both through the CURRENT
        Get-ADRiskScore, matches findings across runs by
        Category+Issue+AffectedObject (Get-ADFindingMatchKey), and returns a
        structured delta object: new / resolved / still-open / changed
        findings, score delta, per-category delta, and maturity delta.

        Performs NO AD/LDAP queries, uses NO credentials, and needs NO
        network access to any domain controller - pure offline aggregation
        of exports this module already produces.
    .PARAMETER BaselinePath
        Either an explicit AD_Security_Audit_<timestamp>.json file, or a
        folder to search for the newest one (same idiom as
        Get-ADForestConsolidation's -ReportPath resolution).
    .PARAMETER RetestPath
        Same shape as -BaselinePath, for the later (retest) run.
    .PARAMETER ToJson
        Optional. Also persist the result to this path
        (AD_Retest_Comparison_<timestamp>.json convention), mirroring
        Get-ADSnapshot's/Get-ADForestConsolidation's -ToJson convention.
    .PARAMETER RemediationStatePath
        Optional. Path to a remediation-state file (see RemediationState.ps1
        - Get-ADRemediationState/Set-ADRemediationState). When supplied,
        each StillOpenFinding and ChangedFinding is annotated with a
        RemediationState property (Status/Owner/Note/SetDate), so a retest
        report can visually separate "still open, actively being worked"
        from "still open, and that's a deliberate, accepted decision".
        Untracked findings (or when this parameter is omitted) default to
        Status = 'Open' with null Owner/Note/SetDate. This is purely an
        additive annotation step - it does not change the New/Resolved/
        StillOpen/Changed classification logic itself, and omitting this
        parameter behaves identically to before it existed.
    .OUTPUTS
        PSCustomObject: GeneratedDate, BaselineMeta, RetestMeta,
        BaselineScore, RetestScore, ScoreDelta, MaturityDelta,
        CategoryDeltas, SeverityCountDelta, NewFindings, ResolvedFindings,
        StillOpenFindings, ChangedFindings.

        modification of the single-value CategoryBars renderer, since a
        paired before/after bar per row is a different shape of chart.

function Get-ADRemediationAnnotatedFindingHTML {
    <#
    .SYNOPSIS
        Renders a Still-Open finding group (same Category+Issue) the same
        way Get-FindingHTML does, with an added remediation-status badge
        per affected object - reusing the existing severity-badge CSS
        pattern rather than inventing a new visual language.
    .DESCRIPTION
        Only used by Export-ADRetestComparisonHTML's Still Open section,
        and only when at least one finding in the comparison carries a
        RemediationState property (i.e. Get-ADRetestComparison was called
        with -RemediationStatePath). Untracked findings still render, with
        a default "Open" badge (Status = 'Open', no owner/note), so an
        untracked finding is visually distinguishable from a tracked
        AcceptedRisk/InProgress/Remediated one without looking broken.
