    .SYNOPSIS
        Audits domain-wide password policy, functional level, Recycle Bin,
        legacy OS presence, tombstone lifetime, and AzureADSSOACC key
        rotation.
    .DESCRIPTION
        PDC-ONLY CHECKS, NOTED ACCORDINGLY: every live query in this
        function (password policy, domain/forest functional level,
        Recycle Bin feature state, tombstone lifetime) reads a single
        domain- or forest-wide attribute/feature that is identical
        regardless of which DC answers - there is no per-DC state to
        enumerate here, unlike a true per-DC probe. All of it goes through
        $__adServer (Get-ADSecurityAuditTargetServerValue), which follows
        the module's normal three-mode -Server contract: omitted or a
        domain name resolves to that domain's PDC Emulator specifically
        (the authoritative source for domain/forest-wide config); an
        explicit, specific DC is honored exactly as given. The legacy-OS
        computer sweep and AzureADSSOACC check are ordinary domain-wide
        object queries, not per-DC probes, for the same reason.
