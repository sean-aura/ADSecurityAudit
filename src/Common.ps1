# Fixed: -ExportPath (and any other user-supplied path in this module) was
# being handed, while still possibly relative, to raw .NET file APIs
# ([System.IO.File]::WriteAllText, etc.) elsewhere. PowerShell cmdlets like
# Join-Path/Test-Path/New-Item are provider-aware and correctly resolve a
# relative path against $PWD (the shell's own current location) - but raw
# .NET APIs resolve relative paths against [Environment]::CurrentDirectory
# instead, and the two are frequently out of sync (many hosts - IDE
# integrated terminals, scheduled tasks, some launch shortcuts - leave
# [Environment]::CurrentDirectory pointing at the user's profile folder
# rather than keeping it synced to $PWD). The reported symptom: passing
# -ExportPath ".\foldername" resolved fine for the Join-Path/Test-Path
# calls, but the raw .NET write-test a few lines later in Main.ps1 silently
# resolved against the profile directory instead and threw "Export path is
# not writable" for a perfectly valid, writable relative path.

        Uses the PowerShell engine's own path resolution
        (GetUnresolvedProviderPathFromPSPath), which always honors $PWD.
        Works whether the path exists yet or not (string computation only -
        no filesystem access) and whether it was already absolute or not
        (a no-op in that case, aside from normalization).

        The (possibly relative) path to resolve.

# --- Multi-domain / multi-forest target override ---
#
# PROBLEM: none of the Get-AD*/Set-AD* calls anywhere in this module pass
# -Server. Without it, the AD PowerShell module uses a "serverless" bind
# that resolves against the invoking account's own logon domain (or
# whatever DC AD's client-side locator happens to pick), NOT necessarily
# the domain the operator actually intends to audit. In a multi-domain
# forest this produces exactly the reported symptom: an account from
# Domain A running the audit against/on a Domain B machine ends up reading
# Domain A's domain object, DCs, users, etc. instead of Domain B's.
#
# FIX: rather than patch every Get-AD*/Set-AD* call site individually
# (fragile - a single missed call silently reintroduces the bug),
# Set-ADSecurityAuditTargetServer installs a $PSDefaultParameterValues
# entry that auto-supplies -Server on every Get-AD*/Set-AD* cmdlet call for
# the rest of the session, until Clear-ADSecurityAuditTargetServer removes
# it. Start-ADSecurityAudit calls these around the live audit run when its
# own -Server parameter is supplied; see src/Main.ps1.
#
# $PSDefaultParameterValues is looked up by the engine at parameter-binding
# time in whatever scope is active when the cmdlet is invoked, so setting
# it at Global scope here means it applies inside every dot-sourced audit
# function in src/*.ps1, not just code in this file.
function Set-ADSecurityAuditTargetServer {
    <#
    .SYNOPSIS
        Forces every Get-AD*/Set-AD* AND Get-GP*/Set-GP* cmdlet call for
        the rest of the session to explicitly target one domain/DC,
        instead of the default serverless bind that can silently resolve
        to the wrong domain in a multi-domain forest.
    .DESCRIPTION
        Covers two SEPARATE PowerShell modules, not one: the
        ActiveDirectory module's Get-AD*/Set-AD*/New-AD*/Remove-AD*
        cmdlets, and the GroupPolicy module's Get-GP*/Set-GP*/New-GP*/
        Remove-GP* cmdlets (Get-GPO, Get-GPInheritance, Get-GPPermission,
        Get-GPRegistryValue, etc. - all used by this module's GPO-related
        checks: Test-ADGroupPolicies, Test-ADLegacyAuthSurface,
        Test-ADDomainHardeningFlags, Test-ADKerberosHardening, and
        Get-ADSnapshot's GPO collection).

        Prior to this fix, only the ActiveDirectory-module wildcard was
        installed. Cmdlet names in the GroupPolicy module start with
        "Get-GP", not "Get-AD" - the 'Get-AD*:Server' wildcard NEVER
        matched them, so every GPO-related check was completely unscoped
        by -Server the entire time, regardless of whether an override was
        active for AD cmdlets. Get-GPO/Get-GPInheritance/Get-GPPermission/
        Get-GPRegistryValue all accept the same -Server parameter (and
        derive the target domain from whichever server you point them at,
        without also needing -Domain), so this is exactly the same fix,
        just for a second module the original wildcard silently missed.
    .PARAMETER Server
        A domain FQDN (e.g. 'domainb.corp.com') or a specific DC FQDN/
        hostname (e.g. 'dc01.domainb.corp.com'). Either is accepted by
        -Server on both the AD and GroupPolicy cmdlets.

# requiring -Server to be typed for that case at all.
function Resolve-ADSecurityAuditTargetServer {
    <#
    .SYNOPSIS
        Resolves the effective -Server value to a SPECIFIC DC - the
        domain's PDC Emulator, when a DOMAIN NAME was given or defaulted
        to; but honors an explicit, specific DC identity AS GIVEN, without
        substituting a different DC for it.
    .DESCRIPTION
        $env:USERDNSDOMAIN is set by the LSA at logon from the DOMAIN
        ACCOUNT's own domain - not $env:USERDOMAIN (NetBIOS form, can be
        the computer name for a local logon) and not the machine's own
        joined domain (Get-CimInstance Win32_ComputerSystem / Get-ADDomain
        with no override). This means the default now correctly follows
        the operator's account even when the machine itself is joined to a
        different domain in the forest - the scenario this module's
        -Server parameter was originally added to fix.

        Whatever value that gives (an explicit -Server, or the
        $env:USERDNSDOMAIN default) is then checked to see whether it is
        ALREADY a specific Domain Controller's own identity - via
        Get-ADDomainController -Identity, which only succeeds for a real
        DC's own GUID/Name/IPv4Address/DNS host name, not a bare domain
        FQDN. If so, that exact value is returned unchanged: an operator
        who names a specific DC has very often done so deliberately (a
        segmented network, explicit rules of engagement, or simply the
        only DC reachable for this engagement) and may not have access to,
        or want traffic directed at, that domain's PDC Emulator at all -
        silently redirecting to a different DC than the one asked for
        defeats the entire purpose of passing a specific -Server value.
        This was a real bug (reported): a specific-DC -Server value was
        previously always promoted to the PDC Emulator regardless, which
        broke the "only this one DC is reachable for the engagement" case
        even though it worked correctly for the "target this domain"
        case.

        Only when the value is NOT itself a resolvable DC identity (the
        normal case: a domain FQDN, or the $env:USERDNSDOMAIN default) is
        it resolved ONE MORE STEP: to that domain's PDC Emulator FSMO role
        holder specifically, via Get-ADDomain's own .PDCEmulator property.
        This removes an entire category of ambiguity that a domain name or
        "just pick a DC" left open:
          - A bare domain FQDN is not a valid Get-ADDomainController
            -Identity value (only a real DC's own GUID/Name/IPv4Address/
            DNS host name is) - every live-network-probe call that used
            to receive the raw domain name here had to work around that
            separately (see Get-ADSecurityAuditDomainController /
            Get-ADTargetDomainController).
          - Resolving a domain name to "a" DC via the normal DC-locator
            (DNS SRV records + site/subnet mapping) is exactly the
            non-deterministic, "closest DC" resolution this module's
            -Server override exists to bypass in the first place - it can
            depend on the calling MACHINE's own site membership rather
            than the domain actually being audited.
          - Every AD query in a single run now targets the exact same DC
            throughout, rather than potentially different DCs picked
            independently by different cmdlet calls - important on a
            domain with any inter-DC replication lag, since the PDC
            Emulator is also where Windows itself directs urgent/
            authoritative reads (e.g. password/lockout state) by
            convention.
        Falls back to the plain domain/DC name as given if the PDC
        Emulator can't be resolved (e.g. an unreachable or inaccessible
        domain) rather than turning a working (if less precise)
        resolution into a hard failure.

        KNOWN LIMITATION: if the caller used `runas /netonly` (or an
        equivalent alternate-credential technique) to run this session
        under a DIFFERENT domain's credentials than the one they're
        locally logged into, $env:USERDNSDOMAIN still reflects the
        original interactive logon's domain, not the alternate
        credential's domain, since /netonly does not change the process's
        inherited environment block. Pass -Server explicitly in that case.
    .PARAMETER Server
        The explicit -Server value the caller passed, if any. Empty/$null
        means "not specified". Accepts a domain FQDN, a specific DC name,
        or is omitted entirely.
    .OUTPUTS
        [string] the specific DC as given (if it was already one), the
        resolved PDC Emulator FQDN for the target domain (if a domain name
        was given or defaulted to), the plain value passed/defaulted to if
        PDC resolution failed, or $null if neither an explicit value nor
        $env:USERDNSDOMAIN is available (e.g. a local, non-domain logon
        session) - callers treat a $null return the same way they
        previously treated "no -Server given at all".

function Get-ADSecurityAuditActiveServerOverride {
    <#
    .SYNOPSIS
        Returns the -Server value currently installed by
        Set-ADSecurityAuditTargetServer, or $null if no override is active.
    .DESCRIPTION
        A few call sites (forest-root-only group lookups, anonymous-bind/
        zone-transfer probes) need to know and explicitly reuse the ACTUAL
        override value - not just rely on $PSDefaultParameterValues to
        auto-supply it - because they either can't use a plain Get-AD*
        cmdlet call (raw network probes) or need to deliberately query a
        DIFFERENT server for one specific lookup (e.g. the forest root
        instead of the audited child domain) without losing track of what
        the "normal" override value was. Centralized here instead of each
        caller re-reading $Global:PSDefaultParameterValues directly.

        LESSON LEARNED / MANDATORY PATTERN GOING FORWARD - READ THIS
        BEFORE ADDING ANY NEW Get-AD*/Set-AD*/Get-GP*/Set-GP* CALL:
        Set-ADSecurityAuditTargetServer installs
        $Global:PSDefaultParameterValues['Get-AD*:Server'] (and the
        Get-GP*/Set-GP*/etc. equivalents), which SHOULD auto-supply
        -Server to every matching cmdlet call with no per-call-site
        change needed - that was the whole point of the mechanism, and
        the wildcard matching logic is textbook-correct PowerShell.
        Despite that, in practice the global default was observed NOT to
        be picked up for at least some -Server-critical Get-AD* calls in
        production use, and explicitly hardcoding -Server on the
        affected calls resolved it. The exact cause has not been root-
        caused (candidates include host/profile-specific
        $PSDefaultParameterValues quirks, or some Get-AD* calls running
        in a context/scope where the global default did not apply as
        expected) - but the practical, binding consequence is:

        DO NOT rely on the global $PSDefaultParameterValues default alone
        for any new Get-AD*/Set-AD*/New-AD*/Remove-AD*/Get-GP*/Set-GP*/
        New-GP*/Remove-GP* call added to this codebase. Every new call
        MUST explicitly pass -Server (Get-ADSecurityAuditTargetServerValue)
        (or the equivalent already-resolved local variable, e.g.
        $__adServer/$targetServer, where a function has already captured
        one) - even though the global default is ALSO installed as a
        second layer of defense. Passing an explicit -Server value that
        happens to be $null (no override active) is safe and behaves
        identically to omitting -Server entirely; it is NOT safe to skip
        the explicit -Server and assume the global default will cover it.
    .OUTPUTS
        [string] the active -Server override, or $null.

function Get-ADSecurityAuditTargetServerValue {
    <#
    .SYNOPSIS
        Alias for Get-ADSecurityAuditActiveServerOverride - same function,
        second name. Prefer calling this one in new code; both resolve to
        the identical value and either name is safe to use interchangeably
        in existing code.
    .DESCRIPTION
        Two names exist for the same underlying value because a later fix
        (this function) was written independently of
        Get-ADSecurityAuditActiveServerOverride (the original, still used
        by several existing call sites - forest-root group resolution,
        Get-ADTargetDomainController, the anonymous-bind/zone-transfer
        probes) before the two were reconciled. Rather than rename every
        existing call site to consolidate on one name (needless churn,
        highest-risk step for zero behavioral benefit), this function is
        kept as a thin, permanent alias so code written against EITHER
        name keeps working. See the MANDATORY PATTERN note on
        Get-ADSecurityAuditActiveServerOverride - it applies identically
        to this name.
    .OUTPUTS
        [string] the active -Server override, or $null.

function Get-ADSecurityAuditServerIsExplicitDC {
    <#
    .SYNOPSIS
        Returns whether the CURRENTLY ACTIVE -Server override is itself an
        explicit, specific Domain Controller the operator named - as
        opposed to a domain name (or the $env:USERDNSDOMAIN default) that
        Resolve-ADSecurityAuditTargetServer resolved down to one DC (the
        PDC Emulator) purely as a deterministic pick.
    .DESCRIPTION
        Both cases end up as "a specific DC FQDN" by the time downstream
        code sees the resolved -Server value, so the string alone can't
        distinguish them - this flag is set by
        Resolve-ADSecurityAuditTargetServer at the point where that
        distinction is still knowable, and read back here by any consumer
        that needs to decide between two genuinely different behaviors:

          - $true (operator named one specific DC): a per-DC probe should
            scope to ONLY that DC - the operator very often named it
            because it's the only one reachable/in-scope for this
            engagement (a segmented network, explicit rules of
            engagement), and enumerating/attempting every other DC in the
            domain anyway would generate noise or failures against DCs
            that were never meant to be touched. See
            Get-ADSecurityAuditDomainController.
          - $false (a domain name, or no override at all): the existing
            "enumerate every DC in the domain" behavior is correct and
            should NOT be narrowed to one DC - several checks (e.g. the
            anonymous-bind/null-session probes in
            DomainHardeningAudits.ps1) specifically enumerate every DC to
            avoid missing a partially-hardened fleet.

        Always $false until Resolve-ADSecurityAuditTargetServer has run at
        least once in this session, and reset to $false by
        Clear-ADSecurityAuditTargetServer, so a bare -Server value nobody
        ran through that resolution function is never mistakenly treated
        as an explicit single-DC scope.

function Split-ADObjectByTargetDomain {
    <#
    .SYNOPSIS
        Splits a set of AD objects into those that belong to the domain
        currently being audited and those that don't, instead of silently
        mixing cross-domain objects into a single-domain audit's results.
    .DESCRIPTION
        -Server pins a Get-AD* cmdlet CALL to one domain, but doesn't
        guarantee every OBJECT that call returns actually belongs to that
        domain. The clearest case in this module: Get-ADGroupMember
        -Recursive walks nested group membership, and in a multi-domain
        forest a privileged group can legitimately contain members from
        OTHER domains (a universal group, or a child domain's Domain Admins
        nested into the forest root's Enterprise Admins). Get-ADGroupMember
        does not filter these out or flag them - they come back as
        ordinary member objects, indistinguishable from same-domain members
        unless something checks their own DistinguishedName.

        This is exactly the shape of the "wrong domain" failure mode this
        module's -Server override exists to prevent: an operator scoped to
        Domain B can still end up with Domain A objects quietly folded into
        Domain B's findings/report if nothing validates membership at this
        level - particularly plausible if Domain A happens to be the
        forest root (Enterprise Admins/Schema Admins live there) or the
        machine's own joined domain. Call sites that walk group membership
        should use this to make any cross-domain leakage visible (a
        Write-Warning and/or a dedicated finding) rather than silent.

function Get-ADSecurityAuditDomainController {
    <#
    .SYNOPSIS
        Enumerates Domain Controllers for ONE specific domain, correctly
        scoped - unlike a bare `Get-ADDomainController -Filter`, which
        queries the forest-wide Sites/Configuration container and returns
        DCs from EVERY domain in the forest regardless of which -Server
        you bind to. When -Server is itself an explicit, specific DC
        (rather than a domain name), scopes to ONLY that one DC instead.
    .DESCRIPTION
        Get-ADDomainController's -Filter/-LDAPFilter parameter set searches
        the Configuration naming context (CN=Sites,CN=Configuration,...),
        which is forest-wide and replicated to every DC in the forest - so
        -Server only controls WHICH DC answers the query, not the query's
        SCOPE. Every one of this module's per-DC probes (anonymous bind,
        null session, Kerberos hardening, legacy auth, audit policy,
        known-DC-vulnerability checks, stale-object depth, RODC security,
        control-path graph, coercion/relay exposure, the main run's own DC
        connectivity check, and Get-ADSnapshot) previously used a bare
        `Get-ADDomainController -Filter *` to enumerate DCs to probe. In a
        multi-domain forest this silently returns - and every one of those
        checks then iterates over - Domain Controllers from OTHER domains
        too, regardless of an active -Server override. This is a concrete,
        confirmed explanation for "wrong domain" symptoms reported
        specifically against DCs: -Server WAS being honored for BINDING
        the query, but the query's own RESULT SET was never actually
        domain-scoped to begin with - a completely different failure mode
        than the -Server plumbing itself being broken.

        This function performs the same -Filter enumeration, then filters
        the result to DCs whose own .Domain property matches the domain
        actually resolved via Get-ADDomain against the same -Server.
        Get-ADDomain does NOT have this problem - it uses a different,
        -Identity/-Server-scoped code path, not the forest-wide
        Configuration container -Filter search does.

        FIXED (reported regression): the domain-wide enumeration above is
        correct when -Server is a domain name (or defaulted), but was
        ALSO being applied when -Server was itself an explicit, specific
        DC the operator named - e.g. the only DC reachable/in-scope for an
        engagement (a segmented network, explicit rules of engagement).
        Every per-DC probe would then still attempt every OTHER DC in the
        domain too, generating failures/noise against DCs that were never
        meant to be touched and defeating the entire purpose of naming one
        specific DC. Since the resolved -Server string alone can't
        distinguish "operator named this DC" from "a domain name got
        resolved down to one DC (the PDC Emulator) as a deterministic
        pick" (see Resolve-ADSecurityAuditTargetServer), this function now
        checks Get-ADSecurityAuditServerIsExplicitDC, which carries that
        distinction forward explicitly. When it's true, this function
        resolves and returns ONLY the named DC (still honoring -Filter,
        by checking that DC's own membership in the filtered result set,
        since -Filter and -Identity are mutually exclusive parameter
        sets on Get-ADDomainController) instead of enumerating the domain.
    .PARAMETER Server
        Optional. Passed through to both the Get-ADDomain and
        Get-ADDomainController calls - typically the active -Server
        override, when the caller wants to be explicit about it. When
        omitted, no -Server is passed to either call, so an active
        Set-ADSecurityAuditTargetServer override (if any) is still applied
        via the normal $PSDefaultParameterValues auto-injection - this
        matches every call site's pre-fix behavior exactly, so the ONLY
        behavioral change from this fix is the domain-scoping filter
        below, not how -Server itself gets resolved.
    .PARAMETER Filter
        Optional. Passed through to Get-ADDomainController's -Filter.
        Defaults to '*'. Accepts the same string or script-block filter
        syntax Get-ADDomainController itself does (e.g. a RODC-only
        filter), while still getting correct domain scoping (or, when
        -Server is an explicit specific DC, correct single-DC scoping).
    .PARAMETER IgnoreExplicitDCScope
        When set, ALWAYS enumerates every DC belonging to the resolved
        target domain, even if -Server is itself an explicit, specific DC
        that would otherwise narrow the result to just that one DC.

        Added for callers that need the domain's TRUE total DC inventory
        for a purpose OTHER than deciding which DCs to probe/query live -
        e.g. the "Insufficient Domain Controller Count" redundancy finding
        (Test-ADStaleObjectDepth), and the primaryGroupID=516 legitimacy
        check in that same function (a real DC's computer object is only
        recognized as legitimately holding primaryGroupID 516 if its DN
        appears in the enumerated DC set - narrowing that set to one
        explicitly-named DC would misclassify every OTHER real DC in the
        domain as suspicious). Both are properties of the DOMAIN, not of
        which DC(s) the operator happened to scope live probing to, so
        narrowing them to match -Server's probe-scoping intent would
        produce an actively wrong answer (an under-count, or a false-
        positive "rogue DC-like object" finding) rather than a merely
        incomplete one.

        $Server is still used as the QUERY TARGET when this switch is
        set (the one DC we ask has to be reachable - typically the same
        explicitly-named DC that's reachable for everything else in this
        run) - only the RESULT-SET NARROWING is bypassed. This is safe:
        Get-ADDomainController's -Filter search reads the forest-wide
        Configuration container, which every DC (including the one
        explicitly named) replicates in full, so asking dc07 "list every
        DC in this domain" returns a complete, accurate answer even
        though dc07 itself is the only DC this run has been told to
        contact.
    .OUTPUTS
        Array of Get-ADDomainController result objects: every DC belonging
        to the resolved target domain (the normal case, or always when
        -IgnoreExplicitDCScope is set), or exactly the one DC named by
        -Server when it is an explicit specific DC and
        -IgnoreExplicitDCScope is NOT set (empty if that DC doesn't match
        a non-default -Filter). Throws if the Get-ADDomain call, or
        resolving an explicit -Server to its DC, fails - mirroring the
        -ErrorAction Stop every existing call site already used on its own
        bare Get-ADDomainController call.

function Get-ADTargetDomainController {
    <#
    .SYNOPSIS
        Resolves one Domain Controller for a live network probe (e.g. an
        anonymous-bind check, a zone-transfer SOA query, an AD-integrated
        DNS zone read), honoring the Set-ADSecurityAuditTargetServer
        -Server override when active instead of unconditionally calling
        -Discover.
    .DESCRIPTION
        These callers only ever talk to ONE DC (the underlying operation -
        a single LDAP bind, a single DNS query - has no per-DC variation to
        probe, unlike the true per-DC probes that use
        Get-ADSecurityAuditDomainController's full enumeration instead).
        Per the module's "PDC-only" convention for exactly this kind of
        single-server, domain-wide-state check: when the target is a
        DOMAIN (an explicit domain name, or the default), this resolves
        to that domain's actual PDC Emulator specifically - not an
        arbitrary DC picked by enumeration order, which
        Get-ADDomainController's -Filter does not guarantee to be
        deterministic or PDC-first. When the target is instead an
        explicit, specific DC the operator named, that DC is honored
        exactly as given (never substituted for the PDC), per
        Resolve-ADSecurityAuditTargetServer's own established principle:
        an operator who names one specific DC has often done so because
        it's the only one reachable for this engagement, and redirecting
        elsewhere would defeat the purpose of naming it.

        FIXED (reported): previously took the first entry
        (Get-ADSecurityAuditDomainController -Server $overrideServer)[0]
        of the enumerated DC list without regard to which DC that
        actually was - functionally fine for these checks (any DC in the
        domain has consistent AD-integrated DNS/LDAP state), but
        inconsistent with the "PDC-only checks use the PDC of the domain
        in scope" convention documented and followed elsewhere in this
        module (e.g. Test-ADMachineAccountQuota, Test-ADDomainSecurity),
        and non-deterministic across runs/domains since enumeration order
        is not guaranteed to put the PDC first.
    .OUTPUTS
        A Get-ADDomainController result object (has .HostName, etc.), or
        $null if resolution failed.

# Recursively resolve group membership entirely in-memory against a

function Resolve-ADSnapshotGroupMember {
    <#
    .SYNOPSIS
        Resolves group membership from an in-memory Get-ADSnapshot snapshot,
        mirroring Get-ADGroupMember [-Recursive] with no live AD access.
    .DESCRIPTION
        Walks $Snapshot.Groups[].Members starting from the group identified
        by -GroupDistinguishedName. Each member DN is cross-referenced
        against Snapshot.Groups (a nested group - recursed into unless
        -DirectOnly is set), Snapshot.Users, and Snapshot.Computers (leaf
        members - emitted directly; computer accounts, gMSAs, etc. can be
        direct group members just like users).

        Cycle-safe: a $seen hashtable of visited group DNs guards against a
        group nested inside itself (directly or transitively) - AD does not
        prevent this. A cycle simply stops recursing back into a group
        already on the current path; it never hangs or overflows the stack.
    .PARAMETER Snapshot
        The snapshot hashtable (from Get-ADSnapshot / ConvertTo-ADHashtable).
    .PARAMETER GroupDistinguishedName
        The DistinguishedName of the group to resolve members for.
    .PARAMETER DirectOnly
        When set, mirrors plain Get-ADGroupMember (no -Recursive): nested
        groups are returned as members themselves, and their own members are
        not walked into.
    .OUTPUTS
        PSCustomObject[] with SamAccountName, DistinguishedName, objectClass -
        the same useful surface Get-ADGroupMember's live output exposes to
        every consumer in this module.

# queried an explicitly-named Domain Controller that is NOT the domain's
# actual PDC Emulator, because the operator named that specific DC via
# -Server. The check still ran and still returned a real answer - domain-
# wide attributes are readable from any DC - but a reader who assumes

function ConvertTo-ADFlatFindingsArray {
    <#
    .SYNOPSIS
        Recursively flattens a findings collection that may contain nested
        arrays, so downstream code always sees one finding-like object per
        element rather than a sub-array of several.
    .DESCRIPTION
        Defensive guard against a jagged/nested input array - e.g. a
        findings JSON export that (for reasons not fully understood -
        Main.ps1's own $allFindings += $result assembly loop flattens
        correctly, so the nesting has been observed only after a JSON
        round-trip through Get-ADRetestComparison's offline file read, not
        during a live audit run) ends up containing an element that is
        itself a sub-array of several finding objects instead of one.

        When that happens, PowerShell's member-enumeration silently turns
        every property read on that element into an array (e.g.
        $finding.Weight returns System.Object[] instead of an int), which
        then throws deep inside Get-ADRiskScore's arithmetic with a
        confusing "cannot convert System.Object[] to Int32" error rather
        than a clear message about the actual shape problem. Flattening
        immediately after the file is read means every consumer (scoring,
        finding-key matching) only ever sees real, individual finding
        objects.

        A "finding" is anything that is NOT itself an array/enumerable
        collection. Strings and dictionaries/hashtables are treated as leaf
        values (never recursed into), since a finding's own Details
        hashtable is legitimate finding-level content, not a nested
        collection of findings.
    .PARAMETER Findings
        The findings array to flatten (may already be flat - flattening an
        already-flat array is a safe no-op).
    .OUTPUTS
        A flat array where every element is a single finding-like object.

        CALLERS MUST WRAP THIS CALL IN @(...): "$x = ConvertTo-ADFlatFindingsArray -Findings $y"
        silently sets $x to a real $null (not an empty array) whenever the
        result is empty - a fundamental PowerShell behavior (a function
        that outputs zero objects produces "nothing" on the pipeline,
        which a plain variable assignment sees as $null), not something
        fixable inside this function itself. That real $null can then
        fail a DOWNSTREAM Mandatory+[AllowEmptyCollection()] parameter
        (e.g. Get-ADRiskScore's -Findings) with "Cannot bind argument...
        because it is null" - confirmed the hard way: a genuinely-empty
        (all findings resolved) retest export reliably hit this in
        Get-ADRetestComparison. "$x = @(ConvertTo-ADFlatFindingsArray -Findings $y)"
        avoids it - @() around the whole call forces a real (possibly
        empty) array through the assignment regardless of how many
        objects the function actually output.

        Reads a sibling AD_Security_TestCoverage_*.json sidecar, if
        present, given ANY of this module's other same-run sidecar files
        (the findings JSON or the score JSON) that shares its timestamp.
    .DESCRIPTION
        Same sibling-file idiom as Get-ADRetestSidecarMeta
        (RetestComparison.ps1) for the Score sidecar: derives the expected
        coverage sidecar name from the given file's own name (swapping
        its "AD_Security_Audit_"/"AD_Security_Score_" prefix for
        "AD_Security_TestCoverage_", preserving the shared "<timestamp>.json"
        suffix) and looks for it next to it. Returns an empty array (not
        $null, not a throw) when the sidecar doesn't exist - an export
        from before test-coverage tracking was added, or one where the
        sidecar was deleted/not copied alongside the other file, simply
        has no coverage section to show. The caller is expected to handle
        "no coverage data available" as a normal, unremarkable case, not
        an error.

        Accepting either sidecar kind (not just the findings JSON) means
        Get-ADMaturityTrend - which only ever has the SCORE sidecar in
        hand, having discovered runs by scanning for
        AD_Security_Score_*.json rather than the findings JSON - can use
        this same lookup instead of duplicating the naming-convention
        substitution itself.

        Backfills EstimatedEffort/KnownRisks/BackupRollback/OperationalNotes
        on findings loaded from an older JSON export that predates those
        fields (or predates a given Issue's current wording), using
        $Script:ADFindingNarrativeLibrary (src/FindingNarrativeLibrary.ps1,
        mechanically extracted from the current source - see
        tools/Build-ADFindingNarrativeLibrary.ps1).
    .DESCRIPTION
        Reported gap: recreating an HTML report from an old
        AD_Security_Audit_*.json export (Export-ADSecurityReportHTMLFromJson)
        silently OMITS the "Estimated Effort" / "Known Risks" /
        "Backup / Rollback" / "Operational Notes" sections entirely for any
        finding whose export predates those fields (added v1.24.0) - not a
        crash, just missing sections, which reads as the recreated report
        being incomplete/"stale" next to a fresh run's report.

        This is a best-effort, clearly-labeled backfill, not a
        reconstruction of "what the original run actually showed":
          * A field is ONLY backfilled if the loaded finding's own value
            for it is blank/missing. A finding that already has its own
            text (from a reasonably recent export) is never touched -
            this never overwrites real, originally-captured data.
          * The backfilled text is CURRENT guidance for that Issue name,
            not necessarily what an older module version would have
            written at the time - the library has no version history,
            only "whatever the source says today". For a handful of
            Issue names PermissionsAudits.ps1 uses in two different
            finding blocks with slightly different wording, the library
            only has one (see the maintenance script's own conflict
            warning) - the backfilled text is representative, not
            guaranteed identical to what that specific instance would
            have said.
          * Only applies when a library entry exists for the finding's
            Issue name at all - most findings (the ones without
            EstimatedEffort/KnownRisks/BackupRollback in the source to
            begin with) have no entry and are left exactly as loaded, so
            this never invents guidance that doesn't exist anywhere in
            the codebase.
          * Also (re)tags MITRE/ANSSI/Weight via Set-ADFindingMetadata for
            any finding missing that metadata - seeSet-ADFindingMetadata's
            own docs for the related bug this depends on being fixed
            (PSCustomObject mutation not persisting through a typed
            parameter).
    .PARAMETER Findings
        Array of findings (from ConvertFrom-Json - PSCustomObject - or a
        live run). Mutated in place.
    .OUTPUTS
        [int] the number of findings that had at least one field backfilled,
        so a caller can surface it in the report (e.g. a run-scope note).

function Test-ADFindingDetailsKey {
    <#
    .SYNOPSIS
        Checks whether a finding's Details bag has a given key, regardless
        of whether Details is a real Hashtable (a live/in-memory run) or a
        PSCustomObject (a finding that came from ConvertFrom-Json - the
        default, non--AsHashtable parse turns every JSON object, including
        a finding's Details, into a PSCustomObject instead of a
        Hashtable).
    .DESCRIPTION
        FIXED (reported): Export-ADSecurityReportHTML's control-path
        section called $finding.Details.ContainsKey(...) directly, which
        only exists on IDictionary (Hashtable). That's correct for a live
        Start-ADSecurityAudit run - Details is always built as a
        Hashtable there - but Export-ADSecurityReportHTMLFromJson feeds it
        findings read back from a JSON export instead, where Details has
        already round-tripped through ConvertFrom-Json into a
        PSCustomObject. PSCustomObject has no ContainsKey method at all,
        so every one of those calls threw "Method invocation failed
        because [...PSCustomObject] does not contain a method named
        'ContainsKey'" - reliably, for every control-path finding, any
        time a report was recreated from JSON.

        This is the general-purpose fix, not a one-off patch of the
        JSON-recreate code path specifically: any current or future
        caller that might receive JSON-sourced findings (directly, or via
        a snapshot/retest/consolidation file that itself embeds findings)
        can use this instead of assuming Details is a Hashtable.
    .PARAMETER Details
        The finding's .Details value. $null-safe - returns $false.
    .PARAMETER Key
        The key/property name to look for.

function Get-ADFindingMatchKey {

    .SYNOPSIS
        Builds the Category+Issue+AffectedObject key used to match the same
        finding across two different runs (e.g. a baseline and a retest).
    .DESCRIPTION
        Coarser keys (Category+Issue only) would hide partial remediation -
        e.g. 5 stale accounts down to 2 should show 3 resolved and 2 still
        open, not just "still present". This is the SINGLE SOURCE OF TRUTH
        for that key construction - Get-ADRetestComparison (RetestComparison.ps1)
        and the remediation-state store (RemediationState.ps1) both call this
        function rather than building the "$Category|$Issue|$AffectedObject"
        string independently, so the two can never disagree on what a "key" is.

    <#
    .SYNOPSIS
        Converts an array of findings into the flat, CSV-safe row shape
        used for the AD_Security_Audit_<timestamp>.csv export.
    .DESCRIPTION
        SINGLE SOURCE OF TRUTH for the findings CSV column list. Both
        Start-ADSecurityAudit's live export (Main.ps1) and
        Export-ADSecurityReportCSVFromJson (Reporting.ps1 - the "rebuild
        the CSV from an old JSON export" recovery path) call this instead
        of each maintaining their own Select-Object/column list, so the
        two can never drift out of sync with each other the way the CSV
        and JSON exports previously drifted from EACH OTHER before this
        function existed (SeverityLevel/Details, then later
        EstimatedEffort/KnownRisks/BackupRollback/OperationalNotes, were
        each added to the ADSecurityFinding class and the JSON export
        long before anyone remembered to add them to the CSV's
        hand-maintained column list - see the comment above the CSV
        export call in Main.ps1 for that history). Adding a new column
        now only means editing it here, and both export paths pick it up
        automatically.
    .PARAMETER Findings
        Array of findings (live [ADSecurityFinding] objects, or
        PSCustomObject from ConvertFrom-Json - either works, since this
        only reads properties, never calls a typed method on them).

        ready for Export-Csv.

function ConvertTo-ADFriendlyDateText {
    <#
    .SYNOPSIS
        Normalizes a GeneratedDate-style value read back from a
        ConvertFrom-Json'd sidecar/report into a clean, human-readable date
        string.
    .DESCRIPTION
        Every "GeneratedDate = Get-Date" in this module is meant to end up as
        a plain, re-parseable date string once ConvertTo-Json/Out-File has
        written it to disk. Prior to this fix, several of those assignments
        stored the raw [datetime] object instead of a string. PowerShell's
        JSON serializer expands a raw [datetime] using its own ETS note
        properties (DisplayHint/DateTime/value) rather than a plain string,
        so ConvertFrom-Json hands back a PSCustomObject that renders as
        "@{value=...; DisplayHint=2; DateTime=...}" wherever it's dropped
        directly into a report - never a real error, just useless text.

        This helper is defensive on BOTH sides of that fix: it recovers a
        clean date from the old corrupted shape (so already-generated
        sidecars/exports don't need to be regenerated), and it's a no-op
        pass-through for the plain ISO-8601 strings the fixed code now
        writes.
    .PARAMETER Value
        The raw value as read from a ConvertFrom-Json'd object. Any of:
        $null/empty, a [datetime], a plain (parseable) string, or the
        corrupted PSCustomObject shape described above.
    .OUTPUTS
        A "yyyy-MM-dd HH:mm:ss" string, or $null if $Value was empty. If the
        value can't be parsed as a date at all, its best-effort string form
        is returned rather than throwing, so a report can still show
        *something* instead of failing to render.
