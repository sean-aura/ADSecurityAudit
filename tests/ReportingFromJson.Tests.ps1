    Unit tests for Export-ADSecurityReportHTMLFromJson (src/Reporting.ps1).

    These tests do NOT touch Active Directory. Like RetestComparison.Tests.ps1,
    they write a synthetic AD_Security_Audit_<timestamp>.json (the exact shape
    Start-ADSecurityAudit already writes) to TestDrive and feed it to
    Export-ADSecurityReportHTMLFromJson entirely offline.

    Run from the repo root:  Invoke-Pester ./tests/ReportingFromJson.Tests.ps1
